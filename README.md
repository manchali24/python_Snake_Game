# python_Snake_Game

Description: 

Snake is an older classic video game. 

The objective is to eat as many apples as possible. 
Each time the snake eats an apple, its body grows. 
The snake must avoid the walls and its own body.

Requirements:

You must install Python 3.5 or above. I have used Python 3.7

1. Import required Python packages. 
Note we need to import the GUI Scripting API plus standard Python packages: 
a. tkinter, 
b. time, 
c. Image, 
d. ImageTk

Analysis:

In this Snake game, you need to create a snake and a food(apple) for snake.

After when you run this project, you will see output in GUI form.

In this, the snake has to eat as many apples as possible. 

Each time snake eats the apple its length increases.

Snake must avoid to collide with its own body and edges of the window.

If the snake collides then, game is over.
